                I've been looking to make a trasition and have heard some people
                who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and founding 
                it incredibity fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most
                grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                succesfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from proffesionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum 
                and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in
                fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped
                me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving mutltiple offers. 100% recommend! "
